    <h1>fries</h1>
    <p>A delicious side dish that uses potatos.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: 3 large (Russet or starchy potatoes work best)</li>
        <li>Cornflour/Cornstarch: 1–2 tablespoons (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
        <li>Oil: For deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation and Soaking</li>
        <li>Cut: Peel the potatoes (optional) and cut them into 1 cm thick sticks.</li>
        <li>Soak: Submerge the potato sticks in a bowl of cold water (or ice-cold water) for 30–45 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps make them crispy.</li>
        <li>Dry: Drain the water and rinse the potatoes again. Crucially, pat them completely dry using a kitchen towel or paper napkin. </li>
        <li>Heat Oil: Heat oil in a wok (kadai) over medium-low heat (approx. 135°C/275°F).</li>
        <li>Fry: Add potatoes in batches, ensuring you do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook: Fry for 3-4 minutes. They should be cooked through but not brown.</li>
    </ol>
